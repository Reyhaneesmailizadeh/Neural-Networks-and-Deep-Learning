# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
# Introduction
In this course you will get familiar with different realms of NNDL with practical implemmentation of articles:
#
mcculloch pitts, adaline, and madaline neurons. Deep Convolution Neural Networks such as VGG16, U_NET, and etc.
Transformers such as BERT Model and using them in NLP tasks. Vision Transfomers such as VIT and using them for image classification.
RNN, LSTM, GRU, and BIGRU models and applying them for NLP or any other time series data. Generative models such as GAN, VAE, and PIX2PIX models. RCNN and Faster_RCNN for object detection and bounding box.
